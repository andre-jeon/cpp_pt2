LOOPS!

- A way to repeat a set of operations
- Same loops that we used in Python: for, while

LOOPS + Guidelines

- Not used often in C++
    - Often a better pattern operation

- C++ Core Guidelines suggests patterns over simple loops

- I will be teaching C++ Core Guidelines

While Loops

- Use while if unclear how many times looping OR no clear loop var
- Curly braces not necessary if only looping a single line of code

Do While Loops

- Never really used because it's hard to read

For Loops

- Loop that executes a limited number of times
- Use for loop when number of loops known or obvious variable
- Acts exact same as previous code
- 'break' stops loop, 'continue' skips to next iteration

Nested Loops

- Simply a loop within another loop
- Doesn't matter what kind of loop
- Should be avoided
