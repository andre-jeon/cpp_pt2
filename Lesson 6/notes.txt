IF

- Just like python, but parenthesis () ALWAYS enclose condition
- Non-zero values are true
- Relational operators are same: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- Logic operators work the same: && = and, || = or

- Indentation preffered(but optional)
- Curly braces {} surround multiple lines

Conditional Operators

- Represented by "?;"
- Takes three operands(or evaluates three expressions)
- (bool condition) ? option 1 : option 2

Switches

- Alternative to lost of if/else-if statements
- Matching two equal values together
- Only works with ints(+/-) and chars
