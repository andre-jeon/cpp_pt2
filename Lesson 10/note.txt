PREVIOUS LESSON UPDATE

- Array parameters can be declared with []

- When args are copied into function, we are passing by value
- When args are pointers & references into parameters, we are passing by reference

FUNCTION DECLARATION / PROTOTYPES
- Allow us to define the function somewhere else in program!

HEADERS

ADD / REMOVE FILES

- Solutions Explorers > Right Click > Add > Add Existing File
- OR drag and drop files in
- To Remove: Right Click > Remove

#INCLUDE

- Tells program which header files to use
- Angular braces <> surround presupplied files/libraries
- Double quotes "" used for custom files
- Full directory paths can be included but using Include Additional Directories easier
- No need to include .cpp files
- File names should be clear and consistent

HEADER GUARDS

- Tell compiler to only compile code once

- SF.2: May not contain object (class) definitions or non-inline function definitions
- SF.4: Include .h files before other declarations in file
- SF.7: Don't put "using" directives in a header file
- SF.8: Use #include Guards for all .h files(aka header guards)
